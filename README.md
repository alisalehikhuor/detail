When you use .col and .row method to make the project responsive,
it is possible that what is there by default is less detailed,
but "Bootstrap Details" can help you arrange your project with more details






For example:

the width of the col-3 is 25%
But you want 20% width, so you write like this col-3-5

 OR 

the width of the col-6 is 50%
But you want 47% width, so ou write like this col-6-7
